These 3 projects mark the beginning of my developer journey — a path of learning, building, breaking, and rebuilding things until they shine.

I believe coding isn’t just about syntax — it’s about creating ideas that live and breathe through logic.

This repository is where it all started — my first step into the infinite world of programming 🌌

Stick around, because this is just the start of something way bigger. 💻🔥
